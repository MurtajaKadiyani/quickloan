data/ingest.py
--------------
Ingests FastFinance India loan documents into ChromaDB.

Run after seed.py:
    python data/ingest.py

What this script does:
  1. Reads all .md files from data/documents/
  2. Splits them into overlapping chunks (better retrieval precision)
  3. Generates embeddings using a free local model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
  4. Writes the vector store to data/vectorstore/ (persisted to disk)

First run: downloads ~90 MB of embedding model weights to ~/.cache/huggingface/.
Subsequent runs: uses the cache. No internet connection required after first run.

The script is idempotent -- it deletes and rebuilds the vector store on every run.
This mirrors seed.py's DROP TABLE / CREATE TABLE pattern. Participants can add or
edit a document and re-run ingest.py to make the change searchable, without any
leftover stale chunks from the previous run.

Why local embeddings (HuggingFace) rather than OpenAI embeddings?
  Using OpenAI for embeddings would require participants to have an OpenAI key
  from Session 1. We delay the OpenAI key requirement to Session 6 (eval judge).
  all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is fast, free, and produces good retrieval quality for
  English policy documents of this length.

Why are rates NOT in these documents?
  Rates are in data/fastfinance_data.db (see seed.py). Putting "personal loan:
  11.5%" in a document would create two sources of truth. When rates change
  (seed.py is re-run), the document would still show the old figure while the
  database has the new one. The compliance node checks that QuickLoan never
  retrieves rate information from documents -- rates must come from a tool call.

Windows path note:
  ChromaDB's persist_directory requires a string. We pass str(VECTOR_DIR) where
  VECTOR_DIR is a pathlib.Path object. This gives the correct path on Windows
  without manual string manipulation.
